Pseudocode Standard
=====================================

This document outlines the pseudocode conventions and standards used in Birdcam PseudocodeTo Flowchart course.

LOGICAL OPERATIONS
==================

1. IF Statement
    - Tests the value of a logical condition
    - Introduces a set of actions that will occur if the test is true
    
    Syntax:
    if [condition]
        [actions if true]
    endif
    
    Example:
    if x is bigger than y
        print "x is bigger than y"
    endif

2. ELSE Statement
    - Must be paired with if
    - Introduces a set of actions that will occur if the test is false
    
    Syntax:
    if [condition]
        [actions if true]
    else
        [actions if false]
    endif
    
    Example:
    if x is larger than y
        print "x is bigger than y"
    else
        print "x is smaller than y"
    endif

3. ENDIF Statement
   - Indicates the close of a group of actions controlled by if or otherwise

ITERATION (LOOPING)
===================

1.  FOR Loop
    - Repeats a set of actions for all members of some set
    - Must be closed with endfor
    
        Syntax:
        for [item] in [collection]
            [actions to repeat]
        endfor
    
    Example:
    for fruit in basket
        print fruit
        print fruit's color
    endfor

2.  WHILE Loop
    - Repeats a set of actions as long as a logical condition remains true
    - Must be closed with endwhile
   
    Syntax:
    repeatwhile [condition] is true
        [actions to repeat]
    endwhile
    
    Example:
    set continue = true
    while continue is true
        do Calculate size(fruit)
        print size
        print "Want to continue?"
        get response
        if response is No
            set continue = false
        endif
    endwhile

FORMATTING RULES
================

1. INDENTING
    - Indent all actions controlled by a logical or looping construction 
        the same number of spaces or tabs
    - For nested (included) logical or looping constructions, indent again 
        to show the structure
   
    Example:
    set total = 0
    for x in range 0 to 10
        if x/2 equals 0
            set total = total + x
        endif
    endfor

2. MATH AND LOGICAL SYMBOLS
    - You may use either words ("is larger than") or symbols (>)
    - Do NOT use the symbol = for "equals"
    - The = symbol should be used ONLY to set values
   
   Correct:
   - if x equals y
   - if x > y
   - set total = 0
   
   Incorrect:
   - if x = y (for comparison)

COMPLETE EXAMPLE
================

set total = 0
for x in range 0 to 10
    if x/2 equals 0
        set total = total + x
    endif
endfor
print "Total of even numbers from 0 to 10: " + total

SUMMARY OF KEYWORDS
===================

Control Structures:
- if / endif
- else
- for / endfor
- while / endwhile

Operations:
- set (for assignment)
- print (for output)
- get (for input)
- do (for function calls)

Comparison Operators (words):
- equals

Comparison Operators (symbols):
- > (greater than)
- < (less than)
- >= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

Note: Always use proper indentation to show program structure and nesting levels.
